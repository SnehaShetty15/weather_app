## ‚úÖ Running the Application (2 minutes)

### Step 7: Start the App
```bash
python app.py
```

### Step 8: Open in Browser
- [ ] Open your web browser
- [ ] Go to: http://localhost:5000
- [ ] You see the Smart Weather App home page!

### Step 9: Test Functionality
- [ ] Click "Agriculture Mode" or "Travel Mode"
- [ ] Try auto-detect location
- [ ] Weather data loads successfully
- [ ] Charts display correctly

## ‚úÖ Optional: Run Demo Script

To test without the web interface:
```bash
python demo.py
```
- [ ] Demo runs successfully
- [ ] Shows weather data for sample locations

## üéâ Success Criteria

You're all set if you can:
- ‚úÖ See the home page in your browser
- ‚úÖ Auto-detect or search for a location
- ‚úÖ View weather data and forecasts
- ‚úÖ See recommendations for agriculture or travel
- ‚úÖ Interactive charts are working

## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: "Module not found" error
**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure virtual environment is activated
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
# Then reinstall
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Problem: "API key error" or "401 Unauthorized"
**Solutions:**
1. Check if API key is correct in .env file
2. Wait 10-15 minutes after creating account
3. Verify key at: https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys
4. Make sure there are no spaces before/after the key

### Problem: Port 5000 already in use
**Solution:**
Edit `app.py`, change the last line:
```python
app.run(host=Config.HOST, port=8080, debug=Config.DEBUG)
```
Then access at: http://localhost:8080

### Problem: Location detection fails
**Solutions:**
1. Try manual location search instead
2. Check your internet connection
3. Some networks/VPNs block geolocation

### Problem: Charts not displaying
**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Try a different browser
3. Clear browser cache
4. Ensure matplotlib and plotly installed correctly

### Problem: Slow performance
**Solutions:**
1. Free API tier has rate limits
2. Close other applications
3. Try a different location (less data)
